#Read Me
In this exercise, we were directed to create a button that when pushed, displayed an arrow left or right randomly.
To resolve this problem, I used JavaScript's math.random() function and set everything <= 5 to be a green arrow and everything >= 6 to be a blue arrow.

#How to Run
In your terminal, run http-server -p 4040.

In your browswer, navigate to 127.0.0.1:4040.
